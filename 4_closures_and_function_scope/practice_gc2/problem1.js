/* 
Yes, JavaScript is a Garbage Collection language. When a `.js` file is executed,
JavaScript will automatically employ garbage collection, which occurs at an
abstract timeframe. In order for values to be eligable for garbage collection,
there must be no references left in the program pointing to that value in
memory, including those within an object's closure.
